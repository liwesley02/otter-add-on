# Security Analysis and Best Practices

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Otter Order Consolidator extension and identifies areas that need attention.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. HTML Escaping
- All user-generated content (customer names, order numbers, item names) is escaped using `escapeHtml()` function
- Prevents XSS attacks through malicious customer/item names
- Located in `utils/htmlEscape.js`

### 2. Content Security
- Extension runs in isolated content script context
- No use of `eval()` or `new Function()`
- No dynamic script injection
- All HTML generation uses template literals with proper escaping

### 3. Permission Scope
- Limited permissions in manifest.json
- Only requests necessary permissions:
  - `storage` - for saving settings
  - `activeTab` - for current tab access
  - `tabs` - for tab management
  - `webRequest` - for network monitoring
- Host permissions limited to `tryotter.com` domains only

### 4. Data Handling
- No sensitive data (passwords, tokens) stored in localStorage
- Only order and UI state data is cached
- Clear button properly wipes all cached data
- No data sent to external servers

## Potential Security Concerns

### 1. DOM Manipulation
- Uses `innerHTML` for performance, but all content is escaped
- Consider using DOM APIs for future versions

### 2. Message Passing
- Extension uses Chrome message passing securely
- No `postMessage` to untrusted origins

### 3. Network Requests
- Extension only monitors network traffic, doesn't make external requests
- No API keys or secrets in code

## Security Checklist

✅ HTML content is escaped
✅ No eval() or dynamic code execution
✅ Limited permission scope
✅ No sensitive data exposure
✅ Secure message passing
✅ No external data transmission
✅ Input validation for numbers/IDs
✅ Safe localStorage usage

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Review code before major releases
2. **Update Dependencies**: Keep Chrome Extension APIs up to date
3. **Monitor for XSS**: Test with malicious input in customer/item names
4. **Code Review**: Have security-focused code reviews for HTML generation

## Reporting Security Issues
