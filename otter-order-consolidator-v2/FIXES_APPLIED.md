# Fixes Applied to Otter Order Consolidator

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Modal Closing Issue
- **Problem**: "Modal close failed" errors when extracting order details
- **Fix**: Enhanced modal closing with multiple strategies:
  - Try multiple close button selectors
  - Click backdrop/overlay
  - Force navigation back to orders page as fallback

### 2. Order Detection Issue  
- **Problem**: "No order rows found with known selectors"
- **Fix**: Updated order detection to be more flexible:
  - Accept alphanumeric order numbers (not just numeric)
  - Check for order-info-subtext element presence
  - Added fallback selectors based on HTML structure

### 3. Leader/Follower Mode Persistence
- **Problem**: Tab kept reverting to follower mode
- **Fix**: Added mode locking to prevent unwanted switching:
  - Force leader mode when no other tabs exist
  - Lock mode once set to prevent reversion
  - URL parameter `?leader=true` forces leader mode

### 4. Extension Context Invalid Errors
- **Problem**: Chrome extension context gets invalidated
- **Fix**: Added error handling:
  - Catch extension context errors gracefully
  - Force leader mode when context is invalid
  - Skip broadcasting when context is lost

## How to Use Now

### Option 1: Normal Use
1. Go to chrome://extensions and refresh the extension
2. Navigate to https://app.tryotter.com/orders
3. Extension should automatically become leader if no other tabs

### Option 2: Force Leader Mode
Navigate to: https://app.tryotter.com/orders?leader=true

This forces the tab to be leader regardless of other tabs.

## What the Extension Does

1. **Extracts Orders**: Clicks each order to get full details including sizes
2. **Batches Items**: Groups identical items by size and modifiers  
3. **Creates Waves**: Organizes orders by wait time:
   - URGENT (15+ min) - Red
   - WARNING (8-15 min) - Orange  
   - NORMAL (0-8 min) - Green
4. **Updates Live**: Monitors for new orders automatically

## If Issues Persist

The extension needs to click orders to get size information. If modal closing still fails:

1. Check if Otter's UI has changed
2. Use the emergency extraction script that doesn't require clicking
3. Report the specific close button HTML so we can update selectors

## Note on Multi-Tab Feature

The multi-tab leader/follower system added complexity without much benefit. The extension now works best with a single tab open.
